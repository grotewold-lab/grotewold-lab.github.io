*Professional interests and goals:*  I am interested in discovering the genetic factors and associated regulatory networks involved in plant reproductive development and other important biological processes to improve the agronomic potential of crop plants. Here, my research project encircles around the elucidation of regulatory processes associated with the control of ovule development in tomato. The ovule is an important female reproductive organ that determines fruit formation and yield success following fertilization.  In addition, I will work on the control of lipids metabolism for modulating oilseed production in various Brassicaceae species. And on the elucidation of the structure of various plant transcription factors. 

*General interests:* Reading books, swimming, and playing cricket.
