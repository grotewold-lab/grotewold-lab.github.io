*Professional interests and goals:*  Currently I have been working on the characterization transcription factors involved in the synthesis, degradation and storage of fatty acids, and carbon fluxes in oil seed plants (Camelina and Pennycress).  Additionally, I am working on updating the annotation of Pennycress, using data from different sequencing technologies and the identification of SNPs through various Pennycress accessions in order to identify promising material for the breeding program. I am interested in plant genome evolution research and the development of software.
 
*General interests:* I enjoy dancing, hiking and traveling.
