*Professional interests and goals:* I joined the Grotewold lab in 2015 as a visiting scholar. During this time, I have been working as lab manager as well as a member of different projects aimed at the identification of maize protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (PPI and PDI, respectively), and validation of TFs candidates involved in lipid regulation in Camelina and Pennycress. 
At the professional level, I am interested in continually improving my leadership as lab manager, as well as the development of new skills related to communication and sharing of science. 

*General interests:*  During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, my little baby boy, and traveling.
