Professional Interests and Goals: I graduated from MSU in 2021 with a bachelor's in Plant Biology and minors in anthropology and horticulture. I am interested in the intersection of plant science, horticulture, and human culture. During my undergrad I worked with Solanum lycopersicom to elucidate the pathway that creates acylsugars with the goal of amplifying tomato's natural chemical defense against herbivory. My current interest is on characterizing cell and tissue specific promoters in Camelina sativa and their transcription factors that participate in the regulation of the promoters to promote oil production for the purpose of creating biofuel.

General Interests: Fiber arts, gardening, volunteering, outdoor activities
