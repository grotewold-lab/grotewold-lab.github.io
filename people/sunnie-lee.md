*Professional interests and goals:* I have been largely interested in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in medicinal plants since I was a graduate student. Previously, I worked with herbal plants used widely in a commercial market but were not a major concern in scientific fields. The molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of useful metabolites in herbal plants encompasses many fascinating aspects, however, the study of herbal plants also has various limitations. Currently, I am focusing on the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway which is one of the well-known specialized metabolic biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis; more specifically, how the interaction of R2R3-MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors cooperate to regulate anthocyanin accumulation in maize and Arabidopsis. It is intriguing how bHLH TFs/R2R3-MYB transcription factors with very similar DNA-binding domains display regulatory specificity, and how specialized metabolites move within cells. Additionally, I am also working on elucidating the mechanisms by which seed oils are synthesized in Camelina and Pennycress, as well as understanding the diversity of quinoa germplasms. Feel free to stop by to discuss my research or any other scientific topic with me.

*General interests:* Playing musical instruments, going to concerts and art museums
