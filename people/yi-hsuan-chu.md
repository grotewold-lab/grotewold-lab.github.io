*Professional interests and goals:* I am working on elucidating the gene regulatory networks involving phenylpropanoid pathway in maize. I identify protein-DNA interactions through DNA affinity purification (DAP) as well as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) techniques. I would like to combine phenotypic data, genetic information and molecular approaches to improve the quality of crops and fruits in the future.  

*General Interests:*  climbing mountains, cross-country ski, reading books.
