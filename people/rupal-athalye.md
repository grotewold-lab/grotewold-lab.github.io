*Professional interests and goals*:I’m Rupal, a senior, majoring in Biology through Lyman Briggs College. I’m interested in plant genetics and molecular biology, and I am currently working on CRISPR-edited Camelina plants to explore whether edits across all three subgenomes are required to alter seed oil synthesis. Looking ahead, I hope to apply the skills I have developed in plant molecular biology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology research, where I aim to explore new ways of translating genetic insights into practical applications that advance human health.
