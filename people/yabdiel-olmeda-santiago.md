*Professional interests and goals:* I am mainly interested in protein structure & function, as well as cell physiology (protein transport, interactions with exogenous/endogenous substances that provoke biochemical cascades). Short-term goals include obtaining a masterâ€™s degree in biochemistry and molecular biology; long-term goals include performing research in molecular ecology or cell physiology.

*General interests:*  I love going on hikes and to be able to observe nature with both admiration and scientific value.
