Professional interests and goals: Currently, I am comparing our ability to determine transcription start sites (TSS) in maize using CAGE and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. Using these data, I am also interested in determining TSS usage and gene expression differences in parents and F1s and if alternate TSSs contribute to transcript and protein diversity following alternative splicing.
