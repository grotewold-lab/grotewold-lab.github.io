*Professional interests and goals:*  My research interests lie around structural biology, where I use crystallization techniques to solve protein structures. I like to experiment with programming, data analysis, bioinformatics, and computational biochemistry in my free time. I am working to understand the different functions of R (maize) protein using structural biology techniques.

*General interests:*  Chess, biking, cooking
