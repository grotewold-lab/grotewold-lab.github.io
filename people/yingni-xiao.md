My research is focused on mining the quantitative traits locus (QTL) related to nutritional quality in sweet corn using multi-omics approaches, and developing molecular markers for nutritional quality improvement in sweet corn breeding. I am very interested in the changes of metabolic profiling in sweet corn kernels during seed germination stage and post-harvest storage. Flavones play an important role in these processes.
