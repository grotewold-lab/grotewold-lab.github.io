*Professional interests and goals:*  My main research interests lie in discovering plant specialized metabolite pathways and applying nature’s toolbox in biotechnology for human health and sustainability. In my current research work, I combine “omics” with genetics, biochemistry, and engineering to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds in maize.

*General interests:*  Nature photography and being outdoors, music & arts, and improvisational cooking
