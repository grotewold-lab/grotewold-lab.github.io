Professional interests and goals: As a graduate student, my interests reside in the resilience of maize and sorghum, two closely related grasses with far-reaching agronomic significance. More specifically, I am interested in phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and how they offer benefits to these plants. Additionally, I am interested in unraveling the genetic contributors to these compounds and how these genes relate between maize and sorghum. I am motivated to pursue these topics given our changing climate and the need for innovative solutions as our food supply is increasingly threatened.

General interests: Traveling, running, basketball, and audiobooks.
