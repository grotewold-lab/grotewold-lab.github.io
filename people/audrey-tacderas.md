*Professional interests and goals:*  I am interested in all aspects of biochemistry and its many applications, but I am most interested in cosmetic science and chemistry, particularly in the area of research and formulation. I'm especially interested in formulations that are as plant based as they can be, as well as how to obtain those ingredients in the most sustainable way possible.

*General interests:*  music and singing, movies, playing Stardew Valley, baking, and reading.
