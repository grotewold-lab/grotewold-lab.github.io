*Professional interests and goals*:I am interested in attending Dental School following my undergraduate studies at Michigan State University. My primary research interest lies in understanding the biochemical pathways of Camelina sativa, particularly how genetic modification can be leveraged to enhance oil biosynthesis for biodiesel applications. I am also interested in investigating the role of transcription factors in regulating oil-associated phenotypes, utilizing CRISPR-Cas9â€“mediated genome editing in seeds to assess phenotypic outcomes. My overarching goal is to contribute to environmental sustainability by exploring how plants can be engineered as renewable resources.
