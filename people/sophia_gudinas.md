Professional interests and goals: I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in biotechnology, with a specific focus on plant sciences. My main interest is understanding the biochemical pathways in maize which can be genetically modified to increase crop yield and stress response. I would like to investigate transcriptional regulation of phenolic compounds in maize, using CRISPR edited plants to observe phenotypes and accumulation of these compounds. My overall goal is to contribute to the mitigation of anthropogenic effects on the agricultural industry and the environment.
