title: New FPLC System!!
---

The Grotewold lab now has a Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system.  The FPLC allows the user to separate and purify proteins.  FPLC generally uses a higher flow rate and lower pressures to move the buffers and sample through the separating column.  If you are interested in learning more, please contact [Jag](mailto:silwalja@chemistry.msu.edu) with any questions.
