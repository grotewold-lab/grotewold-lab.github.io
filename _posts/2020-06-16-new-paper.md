title: New Paper in Nature Communication-Synergy between the anthocyanin and RDR6/SGS3/DCL4 siRNA pathways expose hidden features of Arabidopsis carbon metabolism
---

Join me in congratulating Nan Jiang on his recent publication in Nature Communication!  The above photo's are of the main authors on the paper; from left to right:  Aimer Gutierrez, Nan Jiang, and Sunnie Lee.  The bottom picture is a main finding of the paper:  Arabidopsis seedlings under AIC to induce anthocyanins.  The paper is entitled:  Synergy between the anthocyanin and RDR6/SGS3/DCL4 siRNA pathways expose hidden features of Arabidopsis carbon metabolism.  If you are interested in reading the paper, a link can be found [here](www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16289-3).  Also, check out [this article](https://natsci.msu.edu/news/natsci-scientists-shake-up-balancing-act-of-plant-metabolism/) on the NatSci news page about this paper and the authors!  Once again congratulations Nan, Aimer, and Sunnie!
