The Grotewold lab would like to welcome its newest members to our team!  Welcome Shannon Schrope and Yabdiel Olmeda Santiago!  Shannon and Yabdiel are two students part of the SiGuE program and will be working with us during the fall semester.  Shannon and Yabdiel will be working with Sunnie and Lina to help them gain exposure to academic research and expand their knowledge about working in a laboratory and learning different techniques.  Please join us in welcoming Shannon and Yabdiel to our group!
