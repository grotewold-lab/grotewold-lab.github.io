title: GRASSIUS updated
---

[grassius.org](https://grassius.org) has been updated! Now featuring multiple maize genome versions, Protein-DNA Interactions,
and a public BLAST Server. 

<p style="color:red">There is currently an issue where some visitors will still see the old website.</p> Unlike CamRegBase or AGRIS, the GRASSIUS website domain was originally set up using special Michigan State University DNS nameservers. It may take up to 48 hours for the changese to propogate.

We apologize for the inconvenience. While this issue persists, the alternative url grassius.eglab-dev.com will remain active and point to the updated website.
