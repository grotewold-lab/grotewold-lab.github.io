The Grotewold lab would like to welcome its newest member to the team!  Welcome Esteban López Cano!  Esteban is coming to us (virtually for now) from Colombia and will physically join the lab in January 2021.  Esteban will be working primarily with improving the front- and back-end of GRASSIUS as well as implementing some other computational tasks for the lab.  Please join us in welcoming Esteban to our group!
